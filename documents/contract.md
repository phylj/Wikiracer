# Team Contract
---
## Communication:
---
1. **Team Meetings:**
Our team will meet weekly 10-11 AM on Tuesdays in person at ISR. Each person will rotate being the designated note-taker in the meetings, starting with Phyllis. The notes will all be collected in a Google Doc, marked for each meeting. The note-taker for the week will also be primarily responsible for writing that week’s development log, which will be reviewed by all other team members before being added to the log.md file.
2. **Assistance:**
Team members can contact each other via the Snapchat group chat, email, or Discord. Group members are expected to respond within 1 business day of receiving the text.
3. **Respect:**
Team members are expected to listen respectfully to each other and reach common agreement. Everyone’s voice should be heard and considered. The week’s note taker should ensure that everyone is on the same page and focused on the meeting. Should any disagreements arise, conflicts will be resolved through a majority, although unanimous agreement is preferred.

## Collaboration: 
---
1. **Work distribution:**
We will assign workload for this project by discussing issues and next steps during our weekly meetings and having each member pick an issue to work on, ensuring that each member has roughly the same amount of work to complete. Unexpected complications and unforeseen work will be delegated on a case-by-case basis. 
2. **Time commitment:**
Each member is expected to spend around 3 hours per week working on this project and to meet all deadlines agreed upon. In addition, each member is expected to attend team meetings and respond to the group chat. If a person requires assistance on their work, the other members will work to help them as necessary. If a member is continually lacking in their work, they will be nicely asked by the other members to explain their circumstances, and further resolutions will be determined from there.
3. **Conflict resolution:**
When there is a disagreement between team members, each person is expected to be clear and respectful in expressing their viewpoint. If one person is habitually behind on their work, there will be a group discussion about how to improve that person’s performance.
